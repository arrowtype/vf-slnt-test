# Fonts for testing italics

These fonts are prepped specifically to test browser support for the `font-style` property and different combinations of the variable axes Slant (`slnt`) and Italic (`ital`).

The fonts are adapted from [Recursive](https://github.com/arrowtype/recursive), by Arrow Type.
